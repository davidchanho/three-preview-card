## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I further developed my understanding of media queries and the use of rem.
I incorporated font faces to import font types in react.
I became more used to scss @forward and @use. Other in the slack community have trouble with @forward and @use, inspiring my article in this subject.

### Continued development

I will further my knowledge in responsive design by incorporating multiple media queries in more challenging project.
